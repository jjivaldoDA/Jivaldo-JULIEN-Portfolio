# [1. Data cleaning with MySQL : Nashville housing](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Nashville-housing-data-cleaning)
In this project, we clean a Nashville housing dataset using MySQL WorkBench. The data pertains to real estate in Tennessee. Our goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis and correct potential errors. Steps include understanding the data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data types, fixing data errors, creating new variables, and reducing dimensionality to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

# [2. Data Exploration & Analysis with SQL : Baby_names](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Baby_names)
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I use SQL and data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration, spanning over a hundred years, to understand American baby name preferences. Understanding changing tastes is a key skill for both businesses and parents searching for the perfect baby name!
