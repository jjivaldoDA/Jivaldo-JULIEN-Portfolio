# [1. Data Viz with PowerBI & SQL Server : Adventure Works Cycles Financial Reporting Project](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Power-BI-financial-report-project)
Welcome to the Adventure Works Cycles Financial Reporting Project! This repository showcases my skills in data analysis, SQL, and Power BI by creating an insightful Profitability Analysis Report for Adventure Works Cycles.

# [2. Data Exploration & Analysis with SQL : Baby_names](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Baby_names)
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I use SQL and data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration, spanning over a hundred years, to understand American baby name preferences. Understanding changing tastes is a key skill for both businesses and parents searching for the perfect baby name!

# [3. Web scraping using Python : YahooFinance](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/YahooFinanceWebScraping)
In this exciting Python project, we aim to extract essential financial data of leading automotive market players. By leveraging powerful web scraping libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup, we'll gather valuable information from Yahoo Finance. Ultimately, we'll compile the raw data into a CSV file, ready for thorough cleaning and insightful analysis!

# [4. Data cleaning with MySQL : Nashville housing](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Nashville-housing-data-cleaning)
In this project, we clean a Nashville housing dataset using MySQL WorkBench. The data pertains to real estate in Tennessee. Our goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis and correct potential errors. Steps include understanding the data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data types, fixing data errors, creating new variables, and reducing dimensionality to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

# [5. Data Mining using R : France QPV](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/Data_mining_QPV)
As part of my Master's program at IAE Gustave Eiffel (2021), we conducted a project analyzing 100 political districts in France. The study focused on the economic structure within these priority urban areas (QPV). Using various data analysis and classification techniques, we aimed to understand the differences between types of establishments in these districts and how their distribution affects the rate of precarious employment. Precarious employment includes all non-permanent contracts such as fixed-term contracts, temporary work, and subsidized contracts. Our approach included creating and presenting the database, followed by descriptive statistics like means, standard deviations, coefficients of variation, and a correlation matrix. We performed principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, decision tree analysis, and concluded with logistic regression to identify key insights and patterns.

# [6. PCA using R : World Happiness](https://github.com/jjivaldoDA/World_Happiness)
As part of my master's project at IAE Gustave Eiffel (2021), we analyzed the 2017 World Happiness Report to understand global well-being. This report by the UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network uses indicators like GDP per capita, life expectancy, generosity index, and corruption perception to measure happiness across countries. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with R, we aimed to highlight differences among countries based on these variables and identify key trends.
